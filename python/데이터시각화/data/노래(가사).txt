One, two, three, four
Mm-mm, mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm
Yeah
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse, hmm
And I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts, mm, yeah
For months on end, I've had my doubts
Denyin' every tear
And I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you near
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me "baby"
I know I'm not the only one, mm, yeah
You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
And your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me "baby"
I know I'm not the only one
And I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
Ooh, you've made me realize my deepest fear
By lyin' and tearin' us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me "baby"
I know I'm not the only one
And I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm not the only one
